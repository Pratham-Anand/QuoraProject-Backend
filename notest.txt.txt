Fetch lazy works behind the scene like in case of question will not query user if get query of question is made;

Jackson serializer will force to return everything of question object so we have to make dto response.

rename does not happen in flyway.

@JsonIgnore permanently disables the field in response json.Better to use response dtos.

See how we create mapper class and later on even better approach is to use MapStrcut.
In case of topic we can use StructMap to automatically handle the mapping.
We can make flat dtos also.

** - Adding the @OneToMany in the User entity doesn’t create new columns, it’s purely for JPA/Hibernate to know the relationship direction and handle things like cascading operations. So no redundancy, and no need to touch existing foreign keys in child tables.

topic management done
question management done except search of questions
answer management done.
